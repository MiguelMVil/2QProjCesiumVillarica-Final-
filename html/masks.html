                <p>
                    Face masks are one of the most recognizable and memorable measures put in place by governments
                    around the world to counteract the virus. Our government has placed many guidelines and protocols
                    when it comes to these masks.These guidelines also include where, when, and how these masks should
                    be worn. Additionally, the Philippine government has also required the use of face shields on top of
                    masks.

                <p>
                    There are many guidelines to when, how, and where masks should be worn in public. In general,
                    however, masks should always be worn in public spaces. This is especially true when indoors, because
                    of the lower air circulation. The masks block virus particles in the air that may infect you if not
                    blocked by the mask.
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, if you are sick, the mask will greatly help prevent you from spreading infection.
                    By wearing it, you protect everybody around you including yourself. To demonstrate this, a video
                    from <strong>The Washington Post</strong> shows how particles are blocked and absorbed by masks.

                        To the left, you can see an image of a surgical mask. These are one of the most common masks
                        worn by
                        people, especially in the Philippines. They provide sufficient protection if worn properly.
                        Protection while wearing these masks can be improved if the wearer wears more than one mask and
                        wears many layers of protection. Additionally, these masks are one of the preferred masks of
                        surgeons and medical professionals for civilians to wear.

                        Moving on, we see pictures of cloth masks. These masks can protect you from COVID 19, but there
                        are
                        some consideration that you need to make when choosing to wear a cloth mask. These
                        considerations
                        include making sure the mask has two layers of fabric, ensuring a tight fit on your face, and
                        using
                        a suitable mask material.

                    <p>
                        Moving on, we now look at N95 masks. These types of masks provide great protection. However,
                        these are <strong>not recommended for use</strong> by regular civilians. According to the CDC,
                        these masks should be prioritized for the use of medical professionals, especially if the mask
                        is labelled 'surgical N95'.

                    <p>
                        According to the CDC, face shields alone are not recommended as a replacement for masks They
                        have very large gaps and let a lot of outside air in. This is to be expected, as they are
                        primarily meant for protection of the eyes and face. However, they still have their uses during
                        this pandemic. They can especially be used as an addition to masks or for people who have
                        medical issues that make wearing masks hard.

            <h2 class="gradient">CDC: Extra Tips</h2>
            <p>Here are some extra tips straight from the CDC: </p>
            <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Make sure to wear your masks in public! Especially if you have a medical condition, masks are an
                    important layer of self-protection against getting the virus.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure your masks fit snugly and properly. Make sure there are no gaps where air can leak out,
                    and that your nose is inside the mask.
                </li>
                <li>Remember that you can adjust your mask within certain limits for comfort. If there are any problems
                    with the fit of your mask, you can adapt and adjust. You can wear multiple layers, wear mask braces,
                    or even tie the straps to find that perfect fit!
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="gradient">Summary</h2>

            <p>Now that you know about the different types of masks, I hope that you can make an informed decision about
                how to protect yourself against COVID. Along with other proactive measures, masks can really play a huge
                part in protecting you if you use them properly. Wear them properly, wear the right ones, and wear them
                whenever you need to. As always, remember to be safe and proactive when it comes to your health!</p>
