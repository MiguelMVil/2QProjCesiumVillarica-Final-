                    To many, this part of protection agains the virus is what affected them the most. With the numerous
                    different names and implementations of this group of concepts, it's confusing for many to define
                    what quarantines are and why we are even doing them.
                    <br><br>
                    In this page, you'll learn about quarantines,
                    isolation, and related topics so that you can get a better idea of what they actually are and why
                    they're affecting your life so much.

                <p>
                    In this day and age, the word "quarantine" is thrown around a lot as an umbrella term for the
                    lockdowns, isolation, and actual quarantine. To make it clear, a quarantine is used to restrict the
                    movement of people who <strong>may be sick.</strong> Note that it doesn't mean that all the people
                    in quarantine are sick. Rather, it means that they all have the potential to be sick and spread, as
                    to why they have to remain home. In short, they remain home to protect themselves and the people
                    around them.

                <p>
                    Few people may know that quarantines and isolation are not the same thing. As mentioned, a
                    quarantine is when you're not actually sick, but you still have to stay home. Isolation on the other
                    hand, means that you are actually sick. As the name suggests, you isolate yourself almost completely
                    from other people. The difference between these two are discussed in this video from the
                    <strong>CDC: </strong>

                <p>
                    There are many things that can happen as we are in quarantine. One major thing is that people will
                    be primarily staying home. Everything from work to school to family gatherings will likely have to
                    be moved to your home. This will mean that you have to find new ways to connect with people,
                    primarily online. Most of your purchases and essentials will come from online as well. With the rise
                    of online shopping and groceries, expect to likely be having a lot of things delivered instead of
                    going out to get them yourself.

            <h2 class="gradient">Summary</h2>
            <p>
                To summarize, quarantines and isolation are a huge part of the pandemic we live in. To some people, they
                are the worst part of the whole experience. However, it is important to understand how useful these
                things can be at preventing infection. If no one made contact, no one could get sick. That said, I hope
                that learning more about these things can help you understand them more and make it easier to accept and
                live with them.
