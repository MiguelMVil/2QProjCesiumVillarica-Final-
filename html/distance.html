                <p>
                    Another one of the very commonly stated ways to prevent COVID lies in staying away from people.
                    Governments, establishments, and even people have found their own ways of implementing this thing
                    called social distancing. But why do we need to distance ourselves? When and where is it needed for
                    our safety?
                    <br><br>
                    Learn about when, how, and why social distancing is important. Also discover techniques and standard
                    protocol so that you can include it in your own personal protective routine.

                <h2 class="gradient">How does keeping my distance keep me safe?</h2>
                <p>
                    To understand the significance of social distancing, you need to understand how the virus itself
                    spreads. Since COVID is an airborne virus, it spreads better if people come into close contact with
                    each other. The aim of social distancing is to limit the amount of close
                    contact with people, and thus limiting the spread of the virus.
                    <br><br>
                    This is also the reason why many establishments implement spacing in lines or waiting areas. It is
                    to keep some distance between people to lessen the chance of people getting infected through close
                    contact.

                <h2 class="gradient">Is social distancing limited to only distance?</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike what many people assume, social distancing is not only limited to physically distancing
                    yourself from others. To reiterate, the goal of the practice is to avoid close contact. This can be
                    done in many ways, with many pros and cons for each. One recognizable way however is the use of thin
                    plastic barriers to prevent close contact between people sitting or standing close to each other.
                    This way, close contact is avoided even if the people are physically close to each other.
                    <br><br>
                    A great example is shown in this video from <strong>GMA News</strong>, where they show a classroom
                    of students sitting close to each other:

                <h2 class="gradient">How do I distance correctly?</h2>
                <p>
                    In general, the protocols for social distancing are very simple. Firstly, make sure that you try and
                    stay 6ft+ away from people. It's also a good idea to avoid crowded spaces, where distancing is just
                    simply not possible.
                    <br><br>
                    As always, try and apply the other concepts in this website such as masking and being hygienic.
                    Social distancing is great on its own, but it gets a whole lot better if it's being supported by
                    other protected measures.

            <h2 class="gradient">Summary</h2>
            <p>
                To summarize, social distancing is like almost all of the other protective measures on this website.
                It's a great tool to use in protecting yourself, and can do quite well on its own. It's always better
                however to make sure to use in in combination with other things to give yourself the best protection
                possible.
